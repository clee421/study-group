# Build a Queue

The ask here is to build a service level queue.

Imagine creating a queue system that can support hundreds of thousands of requests a second or maybe
even just a simple local queue. There are no hard requirements, only a system that can enqueue and
dequeue data to and from.

## What next?

Inspired by a [leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/) and [kafka queue](https://hevodata.com/learn/kafka-queue/#:~:text=they%20are%20alive.-,What%20are%20Apache%20Kafka%20Queues%3F,each%20message%20at%20a%20time.) so take a look
and see what makes sense.

### Design

Like all projects they should be well designed. Create a tech spec or RFC - go wild!

Make sure to create a pull request for the design.

### Implement

Code it up! Get reviews from others.

### Simulate

Try stress testing your system. How does it perform?
